                Get medical help fast, day or night. A private visit can be very expensive and
                hard to arrange. With Doctors 24/7 a clinician comes to your hotel, villa or
                boat on any island in Seychelles. This is medical assistance, not insurance so
                no approval for a claim is needed. Get help fast w h e n you n e e d it. This is
                not a requirement for travel to the Seychelles.
